According to: https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.wasmsdk/issues/30

1. Get boost 1.67 here:

https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

2. Move the zip file to /usr/local

sudo mv boost_1_67_0.tar.bz2 /usr/local/

3. Decompress the zip

sudo tar --bzip2 -xf boost_1_67_0.tar.bz2


4. Copy resulting boost folder into eoswasm include folder

- Copy the boost folder which is inside the boost_1_67_0 folder into the eosio.wasmsdk/includes folder. Hence run following command in /usr/local

sudo cp -r boost_1_67_0/boost /usr/local/eosio.wasmsdk/include/boost

5. Rerun your contract by using eosio-cpp

eosio-cpp -o hello.wast hello.cpp
